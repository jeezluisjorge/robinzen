### About Me

Hello! I'm Robin, a data scientist currently located in Philly. I graduated from Dartmouth College in June 2019 with a degree in Mathematics. I love community building, adventure cycling, and hand-drawing animations. 


### About My Website

The current goal of my website (besides [blatant self-promotion](/resume)) is to spread knowledge. I'll be sharing projects I'm working on and step-by-step guides meant for anybody to be able to follow. The projects will range from the [very creation of this website](#) to how I write math papers on board game strategies. As I continue to build out this site, I might have a better focus for the projects I share, but for now, I hope you enjoy the eclecticism! 


### My Other Projects

* Co-authored [*Diplomatic Dynamics of International Treaty Negotiations*](https://journals.calstate.edu/pump/article/view/1920/2044), an epidemiological approach to multi-party negotiations
* Co-founded [Where I'm Really From](whereimreallyfrom.com), an online archive of Asian-American narratives
