### Hello world! 
[Skip the cliched, overly long blog post intro](#how-to-build-a-free-website-for-total-beginners)

If you're reading this, that means I've successfully set up my free personal website! 

In the process of creating my first website, I read a lot of online guides that basically made it seem like my only two options were
1. Pay for a service to make a custom website for me, or
2. Suck it up and go with a straight out-of-the-box solution.
   1. I also wasted a lot of time trying to hack out-of-the-box solutions to look the way I wanted them to, but this was inefficient and pretty buggy.

Thankfully, my good friend [Afnan](www.afnan.io), who is a genius at this sort of thing, told me about Hugo Themes. And now I'm here to teach you! 

This blog post is a how-to guide to free web dev for anybody, even total beginners. Please [reach out](mailto:robinzeng1@gmail.com) if any of the steps are confusing, or if you have suggestions for improvement- I'm always looking to learn and grow!

### How to build a free website (for total beginners)
[1. A very high-level summary](#a-very-high-level-summary)
[2. Setting everything up](#setting-everything-up)

### A very high-level summary

Basically, all you need to create a website are a set of instructions (the code), somewhere to store the code (the repository), and something to execute those instructions (the deployer). You'll also want a domain to make your website available to the world, but that's really the last step. Any website who tells you otherwise is probably written by the kind of person who names a pet they don't even have "Sparkles" and then they buy the pet and it turns out to be a Bruce but now it only responds to Sparkles. 

In this case, [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) will provide a (very robust) skeleton for our code. Hugo themes are pre-built site themes that are incredibly customizable and relatively low maintenance. If you're happy with a theme as-is, the only language you need is Markdown. If you'd like to alter the skeleton, you just need some basic understanding of HTML and CSS and/or the ability to Google, copy-and-paste, and debug.

For editing code, I recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which makes code a lot more readable than unformatted Notepad (which, to be fair, works). Not a necessity, but free and incredibly helpful.

The repository I (and most people) use is [Github](https://github.com/). Not much to say there other than, it's good and it works. You should use it. I also recommend downloading the [desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) for significant quality of life improvements.

Finally, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a solid deployer. It works seamlessly with Github, provides clear error messages that make debugging a breeze, and will easily link to whatever domain you do end up buying. Sign up with your Github account and you're good to go! 


### Setting everything up

First, sign up for [Github](https://github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) accounts, and unless you like to suffer, download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Github desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/).  

Next is the fun part: choose your favorite theme from [Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/). I'm using ["Researcher" by Olivier Roques](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-researcher/), but all of their free options are fantastic. One piece of advice when choosing your own theme: prioritize features, not aesthetics. Coding in a searchbar is orders of magnitude harder than changing the theme color from red to blue.
